                <h4>Breakdown:<br>
<br>
<b>1. Abandoned Theme Park | All aspects | Maya, Arnold</b><br>
Final project for Computer Animation II at Brown University.<br>
This is an art directed scene of an abandoned theme park. It was rendered with Arnold, and composited and edited with After Effects. I was responsible for all aspects. For the full video and process, visit here: vimeo.com/270397802 <br>
<br>
<b>2. Modern Korean Ghost, 처녀귀신 | All aspects | Maya, Arnold </b><br>
Project for Computer Animation II at Brown University.<br>
The character is the Korean ghost 처녀귀신, common in folklore, reimagined in a modern setting. I was responsible for all aspects, from character design to rigging and animating.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Dragon | Modeling & Shading | Maya, Arnold</b><br>
Modeling and shading project for Computer Animation I at Brown University.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Succulents | All aspects | Maya, Arnold</b><br>
Project for Computer Animation II at Brown University. I was responsible for all aspects.<br>
<br>
<b>5. Bedroom | Lighting & Compositing | Maya, Arnold</b><br>
Project for Computer Animation I at Brown University.<br>
I was responsible for shading, compositing and lighting.<br>
<br>
<b>6. Ray Tracer | C++, OpenGL</b><br>
Project for Computer Graphics at Brown University.<br>
This is a ray tracer render that renders 3D primitives made with OpenGL. The path of each light ray from its light source to a pixel on screen space is calculated recursively. The calculation detects collisions to account for shadows, reflections, and lighting at surfaces where light hits.<br>
<br>
First pass - ray-traced without taking shadows or reflections into account<br>
Second pass - effects of shadows and reflections shown on sphere surface<br>
Third pass - textures applied to the sphere primitives<br>
<br>
<b>7. Ampli | 3D Graphical Game Engine | C++, OpenGL, Maya</b><br>
Short gameplay of a final project for 3D Game Engines at Brown University. I collaborated with two other classmates to create a music based graphical game engine, where the graphics updates in time with the beat of the song. I was responsible for building the assets, programming the character and particle generation.<br>
<br>
<b>8. Procedural Terrain | C++, OpenGL</b><br>
Clip from a final project for Computer Graphics at Brown University.<br>
I collaborated with two other classmates to create a procedurally generated terrain with a camera following a semi-randomly generated bezier curve. I was responsible for camera movement and fog generation.<br>
